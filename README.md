# Reinforcement_Game
# We have Model.py as the runnable file
# Learning.py file is containing the learning model for the given game
# We have used Model free learning i.e, Q-LEARNING model for training
Initially we have to import required libraries<br/>
-->Pygame:This library includes modules for playing sound, drawing graphics, handling mouse inputs,<br/>
          and creating client-side applications that can be wrapped in standalone executables.<br/>
-->Random:This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.<br/>

->So the main aim of this game is to arrange the coins in an order where the 4 coins of same color should<br/>

->Initially the computer and the human will be played randomly.<br/>
->Then the actions will be recorded by the model in the Q-Table.<br/>
